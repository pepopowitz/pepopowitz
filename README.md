I'm an engineer at [Artsy](https://github.com/artsy). I mostly work on some of our [React](https://github.com/artsy/force), [React Native](https://github.com/artsy/eigen), and [Rails](https://github.com/artsy/convection) apps. I [write for our blog](https://artsy.github.io/author/steve-hicks/). I'm building [some tutorials to help new Artsy engineers learn Relay](https://github.com/artsy/relay-workshop).

I [lead workshops](https://www.stevenhicks.me/workshops/building-your-first-react-app/), [speak at meetups and conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscuivvUzI), and [write for my own blog](https://www.stevenhicks.me/articles/). I'm building [a log for tracking my run, bike, and swim training](https://github.com/pepopowitz/pendulina).

[Here's a more detailed list of my work](https://gist.github.com/pepopowitz/ff826cb0cf8931da8c13a03e433cb4df).

On weekends I like to go for a long trail run 🏃‍♂️ one day and a long bike ride 🚴‍♂️ the other day.
