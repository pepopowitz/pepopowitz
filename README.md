I'm an engineer at [Artsy](https://github.com/artsy). I mostly work on some of our [React](https://github.com/artsy/force), [React Native](https://github.com/artsy/eigen), and [Rails](https://github.com/artsy/convection) apps. I also [write for our blog](https://artsy.github.io/).

I also [lead workshops](https://www.stevenhicks.me/workshops/building-your-first-react-app/), [speak at meetups and conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscuivvUzI), and [write for my own blog](https://www.stevenhicks.me/articles/).

And then I like to go for a long trail run 🏃‍♂️.
