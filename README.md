I'm a Developer Experience Engineer at [Camunda](https://github.com/camunda). I mostly work on [our documentation infrastructure](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs). 

I stream with my friend [@jonallured](https://github.com/jonallured) and others at [youtube.com/@FriendsWithCode](https://youtube.com/@FriendsWithCode). We built [this Chrome new tab page](https://github.com/pepopowitz/doing-a-good-job) that allows me to read inspiring messages every time I open a browser.

I made a podcast called [A Developer Experience Podcast](https://anchor.fm/a-developer-experience) -- it's less about the field of Developer Experience, and more about the experience of being a developer.

I used to [write for Artsy's engineering blog](https://artsy.github.io/author/steve-hicks/). I built [some tutorials to help new Artsy engineers learn Relay](https://github.com/artsy/relay-workshop). I hosted some episodes of [Artsy Engineering Radio](https://open.spotify.com/show/0gJYxpqN6P11dbjNw8VT2a?si=L4TWDrQETwuVO6JR1SOZTQ&nd=1).

I've [led workshops](https://www.stevenhicks.me/workshops/building-your-first-react-app/), [spoken at meetups and conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XscuivvUzI), and I sometimes [write for my own blog](https://www.stevenhicks.me/articles/). 

[Here's a more detailed list of my work](https://stevenhicks.me/portfolio).

On weekends I like to go for a long trail run 🏃‍♂️ one day and a long bike ride 🚴‍♂️ the other day.
